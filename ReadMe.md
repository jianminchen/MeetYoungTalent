I got an invitation to help a young talent to prepare September Facebook onsite. <br>

July 1, 2019<br>

8:50 AM - 9:50 AM
Since I am preparing for a phone screen, He gave me 50 minutes mock interview as an interviewer. <br>

[Here](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2019/07/a-friend-makes-world-connected.html) is the blog related to my first mock interview as an interviewee. <br>
[Here](https://github.com/jianminchen/MeetYoungTalent/blob/master/Calculator.cs) is C# code I wrote after mock interview. <br>
